All functions are contained in main.py besides secreteclass which contains the api key and the test classes which are contained in test_functions.py.
Project issues a get request to wofoo, converts that requests to dictionary format, and then stores all of the infomation in the dictionary into three seperate database tables.
All functionality is included in this project and is working properly.
